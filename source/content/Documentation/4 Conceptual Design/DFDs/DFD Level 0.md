# DFD Context Diagram

The Level 0 DFD represents the McDonald's Restaurant Management System as a single process interacting with external entities:

- Customers (placing orders, making reservations)
- Employees (processing orders, managing inventory)
- Suppliers (providing ingredients and supplies)
- Management (receiving reports, making decisions)

Data flows between these entities and the central system represent the major information exchanges in the restaurant operations.
