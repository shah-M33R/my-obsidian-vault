## **Project Title:**

Internal Management System for a Fast-Food Restaurant (McDonald's Branch Model)

## **Objective:**

Develop a **comprehensive** internal management system to optimize **order handling, staff workflow, inventory tracking, drive-thru operations, PlayPlace management, and delivery processes.**

## **Project Scope:**

- Rather than rebuilding McDelivery, we will **optimize** one existing component (such as the order queue system, supply chain tracking, or customer loyalty program).
- While each McDonald's franchise operates **independently** under corporate guidelines, our system will focus on a **single branch**.
- The system will optimize **order handling, staff workflow, inventory tracking, drive-thru operations, PlayPlace management, and delivery processes.**

# **Project Stages & Steps**

### **0: On-Site Visit (Observation & Data Collection)**

**Goal:** Gather real-world insights into McDonald's internal processes.

- Observe **order placement, processing, and fulfillment**.
- Analyze **staff scheduling and workflow management**.
- Understand **inventory monitoring and restocking procedures**.
- Identify **pain points** and potential improvements.
- Conduct **interviews with employees or managers** when possible.

### **1: Requirements Analysis**

**Goal:** Define core functionalities and system needs.

- List essential **features and automation opportunities**.
- Identify **key problems** in the current workflow.
- Determine **data needs for storage, tracking, and analysis**.

### **2: Identify Entities**

**Goal:** Establish key system components.

- Define **main entities** (e.g., Orders, Employees, Inventory, Sales, Suppliers).
- Understand entity interactions within the system.

### **3: Define Attributes**

**Goal:** Specify details for each entity.

- Orders: **Order_ID, Items, Total_Price, Status**.
- Employees: **ID, Name, Role, Shift Timing**.
- Inventory: **Ingredient_ID, Stock Level, Expiry Date, Supplier Info**.

### **4: Decision Flows

**Goal:** Map key decision points and process flows.

- Define **order status transitions** and handling rules.
- Establish **inventory thresholds** for reordering decisions.
- Map **staff allocation** decision processes based on demand.

### **5: Data Flow Diagram (DFD)**

**Goal:** Map the internal system's workflow.

- Visualize **data flow** from order placement to inventory update.
- Show interactions between **customers, staff, and backend processes**.

### **6: Define Relationships**

**Goal:** Map entity connections.

- Employees **manage** orders and handle inventory.
- Orders **affect** stock levels.
- Suppliers **restock** inventory.

### **7: Create an ER Diagram**

**Goal:** Create a **visual representation** of the database.

- Design the **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)** to model the database structure.

### **8: Develop Database Tables**

**Goal:** Convert the ER diagram into database tables.

- Design normalized **tables** for efficient data management.
- Establish **primary and foreign keys**.

### **9: Documentation**

**Goal:** Create comprehensive project documentation.

- Document system **requirements, architecture, and processes**.
- Include **data models, diagrams, and functional descriptions**.

### **10: Normalization**

**Goal:** Apply normalization rules to optimize the database structure.

- Implement **1NF, 2NF, and 3NF** to eliminate data redundancy.
- Ensure **data integrity** and minimize update anomalies.
- Optimize table relationships for efficient querying.

## **üîπ Basic Ideas & Guidelines**

üìå **Scope:**

- Focus on **internal operations**, not customer-side features like mobile ordering.
- Simulate a **single McDonald's branch, not the entire chain.**

üìå **Main Objectives:**

‚úÖ Optimize **order processing** (queueing, status updates, priority handling).

‚úÖ Manage **staff scheduling** dynamically based on peak hours.

‚úÖ Track **inventory levels** and automate restocking alerts.

‚úÖ Improve **drive-thru speed & PlayPlace maintenance.**

‚úÖ Ensure **seamless integration** with third-party delivery services.

üìå **What We Won't Cover:**

‚ùå Franchise-wide corporate systems.

‚ùå In-depth AI-based analytics (only basic performance tracking).

‚ùå Customer-side app features (McDelivery is already established).
